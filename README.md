### Library page project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)

Learning is fun. [Here's the project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) for those interested in more specifics.

## Essential Requirements:

- [x] Set up basic vanilla web site (HTML, CSS, JS-ES6).

- [x] Fill out a simple array of book objects for testing.

- [ ] Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own “card”. It might help for now to manually add a few books to your array so you can see the display.

- [ ] Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.

- [ ] Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.

- [ ] Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status. Although I'm not in love with this as a UI concept (what value does a "being read" idicator bring to the user?), Will likely use the basic functionality for something else like "in library" or whatever.

## Addtional Items

- [ ] Add accessibility essentials to [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Accessibility_basics)

- [ ] Add links to Amazon because, why not? Note: this is more practice for another project on my list for this summer.

- [ ] Add search utility (being only local storage makes this easy, right?).

- [ ] Add List sorting functionality for a-z by title, author, or read (in-library) and re-render.

- [ ] Clean up for speed. I'm curious how short we can get "to interative" page load times on a project like this especially with vanilla JS.

Thanks for reading my rambling and have a wonderful day!
